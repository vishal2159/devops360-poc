Slide 1 — Title:

DevOps360 — Self-Healing CI/CD Dashboard (Free-Tier POC)
Presenter:

Slide 2 — Problem:

Manual monitoring, manual remediation, and environment collisions slow down deployments and increase MTTR.

Slide 3 — Solution:

Lock API prevents parallel deploys to same environment.
Auto-Heal Lambda analyzes failures and triggers remediation.
Unified dashboard (Power BI / Kibana) shows environment usage & infra load.

Slide 4 — Architecture:

(paste ASCII diagram or create a visual using boxes: GitHub → LockAPI → EC2; CloudWatch & Auto-Heal → Power BI)

Slide 5 — Demo Flow:

Push commit → GH Actions checks lock → acquires → deploys → releases
Simulate busy env: lock manually → GH Actions fails early (shows owner)
Simulate failure: call analyze-log → Lambda recommends action → SNS alert

Slide 6 — Tech Stack:

GitHub Actions, Lambda (Function URL), DynamoDB, EC2 (t2.micro), SNS, Power BI or Kibana

Slide 7 — Business Value:

Reduce human dependency, reduce MTTR, prevent collisions, provide leadership visibility

Slide 8 — Next Steps:

Harden security (API Auth), use OIDC for GitHub -> IAM, add SSM remediation, extend Auto-Heal rules with ML
